CCSE Events is a mobile application built by a team of 5 students at Kennesaw State University as the Capstone Project for their respective undergraduate degrees. The primary goal of this project was to get students more engaged in and involved with upcoming Kennesaw State University College of Computer Science and Engineering events. The goals for this project were: to be cross-platform (iOS and Android), provide a simple, understandable, and easy to use interface, use currently available data sources for event data, and, preferably, consist of a single code base.
